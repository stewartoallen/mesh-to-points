## Analysis

### v1.0 - Backface Culling (Baseline)
**Implementation:**
```c
// Precompute normal Z component
tris[i].normal_z = edge1.x * edge2.y - edge1.y * edge2.x;

// In ray loop
if (tris[t].normal_z <= 0) {
    continue;  // Skip back-facing triangles
}
```

**Results:**
- Reduces triangle tests by 50% (6,120 → ~3,060 front-facing triangles)
- Points: 600,411 (multiple hits per ray: outer + inner cylinder walls)
- **Native: 4.04s**
- **WASM: 8.92s**

### v1.1 - Closest Hit Only
**Implementation:**
```c
// Find closest (topmost) hit instead of collecting all hits
Vec3 closest_hit;
float closest_z = 1e10f;
int found_hit = 0;

for (int t = 0; t < triangle_count; t++) {
    if (tris[t].normal_z <= 0) continue;

    Vec3 intersection;
    if (ray_triangle_intersect(...)) {
        if (intersection.z < closest_z) {
            closest_z = intersection.z;
            closest_hit = intersection;
            found_hit = 1;
        }
    }
}

if (found_hit) {
    add_point(closest_hit);
}
```

**Results:**
- Points: 559,364 (only topmost surface hit per ray)
- **No speed improvement**: Still tests all ~3,060 front-facing triangles per ray
- Extra overhead: Z-comparison for each hit
- **Native: 4.03s** (0.25% slower due to comparison overhead)
- **WASM: 8.86s** (0.67% faster, within noise)

**Conclusion:** "Early termination" without spatial structure doesn't help - we still do 2.18 billion intersection tests.

## Why Simple Early Termination Doesn't Work

For inner.stl (hollow cylinder):
- Each ray hits ~2 surfaces (outer and inner walls)
- Triangles are scattered throughout 3D space
- Without spatial sorting, we can't predict which triangle will be the topmost hit
- **Must test all triangles to find the closest one**

### v1.2 - XY Grid Partitioning ✅ MASSIVE WIN
**Implementation:**
```c
// Create 2D grid (e.g., 17×17 cells for 84mm model with 5mm cell size)
XYGrid* grid = create_xy_grid(tris, triangle_count, &bounds);

// For each ray at (x, y):
int cell_x = (int)((x - grid->grid_min_x) / grid->cell_size_x);
int cell_y = (int)((y - grid->grid_min_y) / grid->cell_size_y);
GridCell* cell = &grid->cells[cell_y * grid->res_x + cell_x];

// Test only triangles in this cell
for (int i = 0; i < cell->count; i++) {
    int t = cell->triangle_indices[i];
    // Test triangle t...
}
```

**Results:**
- **Native: 0.086s** (4.04s → 0.086s = **47× speedup!**)
- **WASM: 0.14s** (8.92s → 0.14s = **64× speedup!**)
- Points: 600,412 (same as v1.0, confirming correctness)
- Grid: 17×17 = 289 cells
- Average triangles per cell: ~60 (down from 3,060 tested per ray in v1.0)
- **Reduction**: Tests reduced from 2.18 billion to ~43 million (**51× fewer tests**)

**Why this works so well:**
- Each vertical ray only needs to test triangles in its XY column
- Inner.stl is dense in Z but sparse in XY per cell
- Grid overhead is negligible (~1ms) compared to 50× test reduction
- Cell size (5mm) is optimal for this model's triangle distribution

**Key insight:** XY partitioning > Z partitioning for vertical ray casting!

## Next Optimizations to Test

### 1. Multi-threading
Split rays across threads/workers.
- **Expected**: 4-8× additional speedup (linear with cores)
- **Complexity**: Low (rays are independent)
- **Potential**: 0.14s → 0.018-0.035s @ 0.1mm (8 cores)

### 2. SIMD Vectorization
Vectorize Möller–Trumbore with WASM SIMD.
- **Expected**: 2-4× additional speedup
- **Complexity**: High (careful implementation required)

### 3. Early Ray Termination (with spatial structure)
With XY grid + Z-sorting within each cell, break after first hit.
- **Expected**: 1.5-2× additional speedup
- **Complexity**: Medium (need per-cell Z-sorting)

## Computational Complexity

| Version | Tests per Ray | Total Tests | Speedup |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Naive | 6,120 | 4.36 billion | 1.0× |
| v1.0 (backface) | ~3,060 | 2.18 billion | 2.0× |
| v1.1 (closest hit) | ~3,060 | 2.18 billion | 2.0× (same) |
| v1.2 (XY grid) | ~60 | 43 million | **102×** |
